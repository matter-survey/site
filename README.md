# Matter Survey

A community-driven database of Matter device capabilities, powered by anonymized telemetry from the [Matter Binding Helper](https://github.com/cedricziel/ha-matter-binding-helper) Home Assistant integration.

## Features

- **Device Index**: Browse all known Matter devices and their capabilities
- **Capability Database**: See which clusters and device types each product supports
- **Binding Compatibility**: Identify devices that support Matter binding
- **Version Tracking**: Track hardware and software versions across devices

## Privacy

This service is designed with privacy in mind:

- **No personal data collected**: We never receive device names, locations, or any user-configured information
- **Only public device info**: Vendor IDs, product IDs, and capability data that's part of the Matter specification
- **Anonymous installations**: A random UUID is used only for deduplication, not tracking
- **Opt-out available**: Users can disable telemetry during integration setup or in settings
