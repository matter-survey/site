about:
    title: "About Matter Survey"
    intro: "Matter Survey is a community-driven database that catalogs the real-world capabilities of Matter-compatible smart home devices. We collect anonymous data from users' actual devices to help you understand what works with what."
    what_is_matter: "What is Matter?"
    what_is_matter_text_1: "Matter is a new smart home standard that lets devices from different brands work together. Before Matter, if you bought a Philips light bulb, it might only work with the Philips app. A Samsung sensor might only work with SmartThings. Getting everything to talk to each other was a nightmare."
    what_is_matter_text_2: "Matter fixes this. It's a common language that devices can speak, backed by major tech companies:"
    and_others: "and 200+ others"
    plain_english: "In plain English:"
    plain_english_text: "If a device has the Matter logo, it should work with your Apple Home, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, or any other Matter-compatible system."
    why_exists: "Why does this site exist?"
    why_exists_intro: "Matter promises compatibility, but the reality is more nuanced:"
    reason_1: "Different devices have different features."
    reason_1_detail: "A basic bulb just turns on/off. A fancy one supports colors, brightness, and scenes."
    reason_2: "Not all features are exposed."
    reason_2_detail: "Some devices have capabilities they don't advertise over Matter."
    reason_3: "Binding support varies."
    reason_3_detail: '"Binding" lets devices talk directly to each other (like a switch controlling a bulb without going through a hub). Not all devices support this.'
    reason_4: "Firmware updates change things."
    reason_4_detail: "A device might gain or lose features over time."
    reality_text: "Matter Survey collects real data from real devices to show you exactly what each device can do - not just what the marketing says."
    what_data: "What data do we collect?"
    what_data_intro: "We collect only technical device information:"
    data_1: "Device identifiers (vendor ID, product ID)"
    data_2: "Supported features (clusters, device types)"
    data_3: "Firmware versions"
    data_4: "Connection type (Thread, WiFi, Ethernet)"
    no_collect: "We do NOT collect:"
    no_collect_text: "your name, location, network info, usage patterns, or anything that could identify you personally. Your privacy is respected."
    how_collected: "How is data collected?"
    how_collected_text: "Data is contributed by users of the Matter Binding Helper Home Assistant add-on. When users opt in, their device capabilities are anonymously submitted to this database."
    ready_explore: "Ready to explore?"
    browse_devices: "Browse Devices"
