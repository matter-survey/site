# Matter Basics questions
matter_basics:
    what_is_matter:
        question: "What is Matter?"
        answer_1: "Matter is a smart home connectivity standard that allows devices from different manufacturers to work together. Think of it as a common language that your smart bulb, thermostat, and door lock can all speak."
        answer_2: "It's backed by Apple, Google, Amazon, Samsung, and over 200 other companies. If a device has the Matter logo, it should work with any Matter-compatible smart home system."

    is_device_compatible:
        question: "Is my device Matter compatible?"
        answer_1: "Look for the Matter logo on the packaging or product page. You can also search for your device on this site — if we have data on it, it's Matter-compatible."
        answer_2: "Note that some older devices may receive Matter support through firmware updates. Check with your device manufacturer."

    thread_wifi_ethernet:
        question: "What's the difference between Thread, WiFi, and Ethernet?"
        intro: "These are the ways a Matter device connects to your network:"
        wifi: "Connects to your regular WiFi network. Common for plugs, bulbs, and larger devices. No extra hub needed."
        thread: "A low-power mesh network designed for smart home devices. Requires a Thread border router (built into many modern hubs like Apple TV 4K, HomePod Mini, or Google Nest Hub). Great for battery-powered devices."
        ethernet: "Wired connection. Rare, but offers the most reliable connection. Usually found in hubs and bridges."

# Understanding Device Data questions
device_data:
    what_are_clusters:
        question: 'What are "clusters"?'
        answer_1: "Clusters are groups of related features that a device supports. Think of them as capability categories:"
        onoff: "The device can be turned on and off"
        level_control: "The device supports dimming or variable levels"
        color_control: "The device can change colors"
        temperature: "The device can report temperature"
        answer_2: "See the full glossary for more cluster explanations."

    server_vs_client:
        question: 'What''s the difference between "server" and "client" clusters?'
        answer_1: "Server clusters are capabilities the device provides. A light bulb has an On/Off server cluster because it can be turned on and off."
        answer_2: "Client clusters are capabilities the device uses from other devices. A smart switch might have an On/Off client cluster because it wants to control other devices' on/off state."
        answer_3: "Most devices you interact with (bulbs, sensors, plugs) primarily have server clusters. Controllers and switches tend to have client clusters."

    binding_support:
        question: 'What does "binding support" mean?'
        answer_1: "Binding allows two devices to communicate directly with each other, without going through your smart home hub."
        answer_2: "Example: If you bind a smart switch to a smart bulb, pressing the switch turns on the bulb instantly — even if your WiFi is down or your hub is offline."
        answer_3: 'Not all devices support binding. Devices with the "Binding" badge on this site have this capability.'

    missing_required:
        question: 'Why does a device show "Missing Required" clusters?'
        answer_1: "The Matter specification defines which clusters are mandatory for each device type. If a device is missing required clusters, it means:"
        reason_1: "The device may not be fully compliant with the spec"
        reason_2: "The device might be using an older Matter version"
        reason_3: "Some features may not work as expected with certain controllers"
        answer_2: "This doesn't necessarily mean the device is broken — it often still works fine, just without certain standardized features."

# About This Site questions
about_site:
    where_does_data_come_from:
        question: "Where does this data come from?"
        answer: "The data is crowdsourced from users of the Matter Binding Helper Home Assistant add-on. When users opt in, their device information is anonymously submitted to our database."

    is_personal_data_collected:
        question: "Is my personal data collected?"
        answer: "No. We only collect technical device information (vendor ID, product ID, supported features). We do not collect your name, location, network details, or any personally identifiable information."

    why_not_listed:
        question: "Why isn't my device listed?"
        intro: "We can only show devices that have been submitted by our contributors. If your device isn't listed, it either:"
        reason_1: "Hasn't been submitted by anyone yet"
        reason_2: "Is very new to the market"
        reason_3: "Isn't Matter-compatible"
